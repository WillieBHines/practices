<h1>Course Catalog</h1>
<small>Updated August 2020</small>

<p>This school is new and in flux, but here's our main courses right now.</p>

<h2>Will Hines Multi-Week Classes</h2>
<h4>Revised: Fall 2020</h4>
<p>Each one of these is five two-hour sessions, plus a show. 8 students per class, $220 each.</p>

<p>Here's my thing with "levels": they are suggestions. I've numbered them in the order that I think is the most helpful. But this is a small community of students who mostly have studied improv already. So be your own judge. If you're itching to learn about The Harold, jump in there. Conversely, if you're sick of the Harold, try level 2 (chracter/monoscene). THAT SAID: If you've NEVER really done "game of the scene" style improv, I suggest level one first. Don't let "level one" fool you -- it's not a beginner's class. It's just the one that the other three are built on.</p>

<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Level One: The Unusual Thing</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">This is an intro to  “game of the scene” work -- meant for new people and vets who want to strengthen game of the scene. Base reality, unusual thing and using walk-ons and tag-outs to support. How to accept/reject offers. Saying why. Class show: monologues and scenes./dd>

  <dt class="col-sm-3">Leve Two: Character/Monoscene</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">
Working on game, but through character. Turning points-of-view and character energies into games. Being inspired by locations and the other characters. Keeping silly characters grounded. Forms covered: road trip, La Ronde. Class show: A monoscene. 
  </dd>

  <dt class="col-sm-3">Level Three: Harold</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">Meant for students ready for a challenge. Second beats, third beats, group games and connections. Use all of your improv muscles: an organic start, big heightening moves, patterns, being inspired by reality and tying it all up. Class show: Headless Harold. </dd>
  
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Level Four: Montage</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">The most formless, but the most challenging! A montage that still has callbacks and connections. Focus harder on finding a game every scene. Learn about: contrast games, mapping games, heightened reality, peas in a pod, action-reaction, character games.  Class show: get a suggestion and go.</dd>

<h2>Brandon Gardner Multi-Week Classes</h2>

<p>These courses are generally five two-hour sessions plus a show. 8 students, $220 each.</p>

<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Getting Out Of Your Head About Game</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">The Game of the Scene should come naturally out of improvisers listening, making choices and committing hard to their realities.  By focusing on these fundamentals students will come away from this class with habits that make finding and playing a game feel less effortful and more spontaneous.</dd>

  <dt class="col-sm-3">Let's Focus on Acting</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">
    All of my favorite improvisers are also great actors.  They commit HARD to the reality of their scenes, they listen and react to their scene partners, and they allow their characters to be vulnerable and emotionally affected.  Their dedication to the acting side of improv makes the Games of their scenes that much stronger and funnier.  This class will focus on that acting side of improv.
  </dd>

  <dt class="col-sm-3">The Improvised Play</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">This class will work towards creating fully improvised 30 minute plays.  Rather than focusing on the tropes of specific genres we will focus on acting and basic dramatic structure.  As in a monoscene the comedy will come from clear character Games but these multi-scene plays will also be built around the characters’ objectives, obstacles and actions.  Although the plays will almost always be funny we’ll make emotional honesty and commitment the priority.  The class will culminate with us improvising two mind-blowing one-act plays live on YouTube.  Some outside of class preparation will be required. </dd>

<h2>Kat Palardy Classes and Workshops</h2>

<p>The clinic is two two-hour sessions plus a show. 8 people, $100 each.<br>
	The workshop is one three-hour session. 8 people, $50 each</p>

<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-sm-3">The Drive-Thru Character Clinic</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">Two weeks of two hour classes, plus a character monologue/scene screening.  Show up with an idea for a character or two, we'll find the fun, expand the world, and heighten your idea. You'll have some homework. Then in class two, we'll work out your character monologue or short scene. Then you'll have a week or two to shoot your monologue or scene (on your phone is fine!) and we'll do a screening.  </dd>
  
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Character Gym: Pitch and Play</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">In this 3 hour workshop, you will pitch an idea for a character or two, then we'll work together to find the fun, expand and heighten. After that you’ll do some writing exercises to get specific and write a monologue or scene. Finally, we’ll share our work with each other!

<h2>Ronnie Adrian Workshops</h2>

<p>Two hours, eight people, $40</p>

<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Having Fun With The Why</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">Ever think after a scene "I gave a justification, why did that scene suck?" This workshop will help you push past the initial why and get you to the real why of the scene. Leading you to easier more fun games to play.</dd>

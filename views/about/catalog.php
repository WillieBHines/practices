<p>This school is small and always a bit in flux, but here's our main courses right now.</p>

<h2>Levels</h2>

<p>We no longer have levels. We're not big enough to have a program you follow. Instead, just take courses you're interested in. Introductory classes will include the word "Intro" in the title -- those are good for people who have never had any improv before. All others are "intermediate" experience level.</p>

<p>If you really want a very very very loose program to go through, here is a suggested path.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Start: Any "intro" course or a course that involves getting ideas from a monologue</li>
		<li>Next: A course on initations or monoscene or pretty flower. These tend to be structured enough to be good for newer improvisers, but have enough freedom to challenge you.</li>
		<li>After that: Harolds or La Rondes. More challenging and tend to move faster</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Again, these are suggestions. Take the class that excites you. If you're itching to learn The Harold, jump in there. Conversely, if you're sick of the Harold, try Monoscene/ Pretty Flower. </p>

<h2>How Do I Register?</h2>

<p>Sign in to the site. You enter an email, we send you a link. No passwords.</p>

<p>Once signed in, you click on a class and then "enroll" to enroll. If it's full you can join the waiting list.</p>

<p>All classes happen via Zoom. After you are enrolled, you'll get an email with a link to a Zoom session.</p>

<p>A lot happens over email. That's how you'll get reminders, updates, etc.</p>


<h2>How Do I Pay?</h2>

<p>You pay via Venmo (@wgimprovschool) or Paypal (payments@wgimprovschool.com) when you can, before start of class.</p>

<p>If you drop out of a class with less than 24 hours notice, we may ask you pay anyway. If we fill your spot, we'll refund you.</p>

<h2>Does Improv and Sketch Really Work Over Zoom?</h2>

<p>Yes, it's surprisingly fun! You'll have to be a little patient when everyone talks over each other. We will tell each other when we have frozen. You know, Zoom stuff. But yes it works!</p>

<h2>Do I Really Need Prior Experience For The Advanced Levels?</h2>

<p>Some classes have pre-requisities. Generally, we'll make exceptions if you have experience. Email Will (address at bottom of site) and he might grant an exception.</p>

<p>If you have very little improv experience, and you're taking a Level 1 class or a workshop, that's fine! Let your teacher know when you start.</p>

<h2>Mailing List</h2>

<p>Our mailing list is the best way to be kept up on new classes.</p>

<p>You are NOT automatically put on a mailing list when you take a class. You have to explicitly <a href="http://eepurl.com/R2Ytz">sign yourself up</a>.</p>

<h2>Other Questions?</h2>
Ask Will! His email is at the bottom of every page of this site.</p>

<h2>How Do I Register?</h2>

<p>Sign in to the site. You enter an email, we send you a link. No passwords.</p>

<p>Or you login via Google (click "login" on the front page, upper right corner, and you'll see the Google button).</p>

<p>Once signed in, you click on a class and then "enroll" to enroll. If it's full you can join the waiting list.</p>

<p>All classes happen via Zoom. After you are enrolled, you'll get an email with a link to a Zoom session.</p>

<p>A lot happens over email. That's how you'll get reminders, updates, etc.</p>


<h2>How Do I Pay?</h2>

<p>You pay via Venmo or Paypal when you can, before start of class. Payment info is sent after you enroll.</p>

<p>If you drop out of a class with less than 24 hours notce, we may ask you pay anyway, especially if it was a sold out class with a long waiting list (meaning we could have sold the spot). But if we do fill your spot, we won't ask that you pay (or we'll refund you if you paid early).</p>

<h2>Does Improv and Sketch Really Work Over Zoom?</h2>

<p>Yes, it's surprisingly fun! You'll have to be a little patient when everyone talks over each other. We will tell each other when we have frozen. You know, Zoom stuff. But yes it works!</p>

<h2>Do I Really Need Prior Experience For The Advanced Levels?</h2>

<p>Some classes have pre-requisities. Generally, we'll make exceptions if you have experience. Email Will (address at bottom of site) and he might grant an exception.</p>

<p>If you have very little improv experience, and you're taking a Level 1 class or a workshop, that's fine! Let your teacher know when you start.</p>

<h2>Mailing List</h2>

<p>Our mailing list is the best way to be kept up on new classes.</p>

<p>You are NOT automatically put on a mailing list when you take a class. You have to explicitly <a href="http://eepurl.com/R2Ytz">sign yourself up</a>.</p>

<h2>Other Questions?</h2>
Ask Will! His email is at the bottom of every page of this site.</p>

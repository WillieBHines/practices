<h2 class="my-4">Facebook Group</h2>
<p>The school has an optional Facebook group. This is for students to meet each other, plug show, ask questions etc.</p>

<h2 class="my-4">New Will Hines Classes</h2>
Will (who is typing this) will have a new batch of multi-week classes that start after Labor Day. If you're in a "level class" you'll automatically get a spot in the next highest level if you want. Same for people who have taken levels in previous rounds. There will probably be one or two classes that are not a "level" but focus on some new topic. I'm going to figure it all by Friday August 14.</p>

<p>I'll also have a few one-session two hour workshops in the last weeks of August</p>

<p>If you are a current student and you want a break you can always pick up where you left off in the future. I'm excited people want to take these classes and will do what I can to accomodate.</p>

<h2 class="my-4">3prov Shows</h2>
<p class='alert alert-primary'>No shows the week of August 10! But these will be back! As well as jams and other types of shows.</p>

<p>3 person teams. 8 minute sets. 7 slots per show.</p>
	
<p>Teams should have 2 people who have taken multi-week classes.</p>
